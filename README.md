# Customer-Churn-Dynamics
The goal of the "Customer Churn Dynamics " project was to understand and address customer churn using a dataset from Kaggle. I started by cleaning and arranging the data to ensure accuracy. Then, I analyzed the data to pinpoint the main factors driving customer churn. Based on these findings, I developed actionable insights to help the business lower churn rates and enhance customer retention strategies. Additionally, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to present these insights clearly, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data.
Tools Used - Excel, Sql And Power Bi.
